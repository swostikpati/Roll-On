## Project Description

### Overview

Typerrr is an online multiplayer type-racing game, where people simultaneously finish typing tests (derived from the 1000 most spoken English words database), while competing with each other and seeing the cursor positions of all players in realtime. Our project uses Socket.io for realtime multiplayer connections, NeDB database to store user profiles and highscores, and Bcrypt for user authentication and login. The video below showcases the working of the entire website:

### Inspiration and Target Audience

Typing tests and comparing typing speeds ia pretty common thing among people especially those in university. This might feel like a very unusual thing to do, but it does happen. While on the other hand there is a also a large audience that are completely unaware of it such things existing. Surprisingly, most of the university students type at speeds above 50 wpm without even realizing it (and many a times not even touch typing). But needless to say that the skill of touch typing is very beneficial and improving in it can help people greatly in this tech-filled world. What's more? It looks pretty cool. 

Now even though typing test applications do exist, but they come with a lot of problems. The interface of these applications is filled with elements that are very distracting to the person typing. Even some of the most popular ones like [10fastfingers](https://10fastfingers.com/) have extremely basic UI and UX designs that don't give a sense of satisfaction to the user. Typing is a very basic task and improving the user experience can help keep the user encouraged enough to keep doing the activity. On the other side are racing games for typing. These pose a different problem. Some of them are very buggy and rough like [TypeRacer](https://play.typeracer.com/) to begin with. The good ones with really great animation like [Nitro Type](https://www.nitrotype.com/) focus way too much on the race than the activity driving the race. The race element, even though is more addictive and gives the users the motibation to keep at the activitiy, they pose the problem of distracting the user a lot from the actual typing and therefore causing a negative effect on their typing.

One of the best applications for typing online that currently exists is [MonkeyType](https://monkeytype.com/). The UI is clean and  amazing with a wide array of color themes for the user. The elements of user experience especially the animation of the cursor moving through the text rapidly enhance the engagement of the user. The only downside: it was just a typing test and not a typing race.  Why did we need a typing race though?
